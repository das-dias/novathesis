  abstract = {ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) uses data and algorithms to aim to draw conclusions that are as good as, or even better than, those drawn by humans. AI is already part of our daily life; it is behind face recognition technology, speech recognition in virtual assistants (such as Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) and self-driving cars. AI software has been able to beat world champions in chess, Go and recently even Poker. Relevant to our community, it is a prominent source of innovation in healthcare, already helping to develop new drugs, support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance in radiology. The list of medical image-analysis AI applications with USA Food and Drug Administration or European Union (soon to fall under European Union Medical Device Regulation) approval is growing rapidly and covers diverse clinical needs, such as detection of arrhythmia using a smartwatch or automatic triage of critical imaging studies to the top of the radiologist's worklist. Deep learning, a leading tool of AI, performs particularly well in image pattern recognition and, therefore, can be of great benefit to doctors who rely heavily on images, such as sonologists, radiographers and pathologists. Although obstetric and gynecological ultrasound are two of the most commonly performed imaging studies, AI has had little impact on this field so far. Nevertheless, there is huge potential for AI to assist in repetitive ultrasound tasks, such as automatically identifying good-quality acquisitions and providing instant quality assurance. For this potential to thrive, interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and ultrasound professionals is necessary. In this article, we explore the fundamentals of medical imaging AI, from theory to applicability, and introduce some key terms to medical professionals in the field of ultrasound. We believe that wider knowledge of AI will help accelerate its integration into healthcare. © 2020 The Authors.

After an overview of deep learning and the application opportunities for deep neural network (DNN) hardware accelerators, we briefly discuss the research area of customized digital accelerators for deep learning. We discuss how the strengths and weaknesses of analog memory-based accelerators match well to the weaknesses and strengths of digital accelerators, and attempt to identify where the future hardware opportunities might be found. We survey the extensive but rapidly developing literature on what would be needed from an analog memory device to enable such a DNN accelerator, and summarize progress with various analog memory candidates including non-volatile memory such as resistive RAM, phase change memory, Li-ion-based devices, capacitor-based and other CMOS devices, as well as photonics-based devices and systems. After surveying how recent circuits and systems work, we conclude with a description of the next research steps that will be needed in order to move closer to the commercialization of viable analog-memory-based DNN hardware accelerators.}

    abstract = "{Analog hardware accelerators, which perform computation within a dense memory array, have the potential to overcome the major bottlenecks faced by digital hardware for data-heavy workloads such as deep learning. Exploiting the intrinsic computational advantages of memory arrays, however, has proven to be challenging principally due to the overhead imposed by the peripheral circuitry and due to the non-ideal properties of memory devices that play the role of the synapse. We review the existing implementations of these accelerators for deep supervised learning, organizing our discussion around the different levels of the accelerator design hierarchy, with an emphasis on circuits and architecture. We explore and consolidate the various approaches that have been proposed to address the critical challenges faced by analog accelerators, for both neural network inference and training, and highlight the key design trade-offs underlying these techniques.}",

abstract = {Ultrasound pulse echo beamformed acoustic lines are assembled into image frames and then videos of moving, hidden internal structures. Specialized transducer array geometries such as linear, phased, and convex utilize different scanning approaches to create images with differently shaped image formats. The length of an image is a selectable scan depth. The part of the imaging system that processes and scan converts the acoustic data into standard video formats for display is called the “back end.” The relationship between the acoustic parameters and the quality of the image can be measured by criteria such as point spread functions, beamplots, and contrast ratios. These themes are explored through several simulators. The Scatter Image Simulator calculates the images of wire “point” targets from arrays with selectable parameters. The MultiFocus Simulator demonstrates the improved resolution gained by using multiple focus zones throughout the overall image. To offset the rapid loss in pulse echo amplitude caused by tissue absorption with depth, time gain compensation (TGC) is employed and illustrated by the TGC Simulator. Different types of scatterers visible in images of tissues and organs can be classified by their size relative to a wavelength. Speckle, a textured background caused by subresolution size scattering is dependent on the frequency of the ultrasound and beam formation even though it is often mistaken for tissue structure. Examples of speckle are given by the Speckle Simulator. The capability of ultrasound imaging to present movement can be viewed in the Video Simulator. Alternate methods of beamforming and image formation are compared. Odd artifacts unique to ultrasound are highlighted. The quality of ultrasound images and videos depends primarily on acoustics including beam, transducer design, and signal processing and less on image format and measurement.}
